        I am a 4th-year Software Engineering student at the Informatics Institute
        of Technology with a strong interest in web development, particularly in
        Full-Stack (MERN stack) and Frontend development. I am seeking an
        internship opportunity to apply my academic knowledge, enhance my
        technical expertise, and gain hands-on experience in a professional
        environment. With a passion for building efficient and user-friendly
        applications, I am eager to contribute to your team while continuously
        learning and growing as a developer.
